# Hands-on Project Implementation: Mission Accomplished in MultiCloud Architecture

In the fast-paced world of cloud computing, mastering the art of seamless migration across cloud service providers is a valuable skill. In this hands-on project, I will embark on a mission that takes me through the intricacies of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. Buckle up and follow these steps to successfully accomplish Mission 1, Mission 2, and Mission 3 in your MultiCloud adventure!

## Mission 1: Setting Up AWS Infrastructure

**1.1 Access AWS Console and Create User**
- Log into AWS Console and navigate to IAM service.
- Under Access Management, create a programmatic user named **terraform-en-1** with AmazonS3FullAccess permissions.

**1.2 Key Download and Security Best Practices**
- Download access keys in **accessKeys.csv**.
- Always follow access key best practices: never store keys in plain text, disable when not needed, and enable least-privilege permissions.

**1.3 AWS Environment Setup**
- Prepare the AWS environment using provided scripts.
- Enable Container Registry, Kubernetes Engine, and Cloud SQL APIs.

## Mission 2: Building Applications on AWS and GCP

**2.1 AWS Setup**
- Create another user, e.g., **luxxy-covid-testing-system-en-app1**, with AmazonS3FullAccess permissions.
- Download access keys in **luxxy-covid-testing-system-en-app1.csv**.

**2.2 GCP Setup**
- Create a new user **app** on Cloud SQL MySQL database.
- Download mission2 files and set up the MySQL database schema.

**2.3 Build Docker Image and Deploy**
- Build Docker image and push to Google Container Registry.
- Modify Kubernetes deployment file for AWS and GCP configurations.
- Deploy the application on GKE Cluster and access it via the provided public IP.

## Mission 3: MultiCloud Data Migration

**3.1 GCP Database Migration**
- Download mission3 files and import the SQL dump to Cloud SQL MySQL database.
- Verify successful data migration.

**3.2 AWS PDF Files Migration**
- Download PDF files and sync them with your S3 bucket.
- Test the application to ensure data and files are migrated successfully.

By following these steps meticulously, I successfully set up AWS and GCP infrastructures, deployed applications, and seamlessly migrated data and files across MultiCloud platforms. Remember, cloud security, best practices, and continuous monitoring are essential in maintaining a robust and scalable MultiCloud architecture. Happy Cloud Computing! üöÄ

**Mission 1: Setting Up AWS Infrastructure**

```bash
# Command to create a programmatic user with AmazonS3FullAccess permissions
aws iam create-user --user-name terraform-en-1
# Command to attach AmazonS3FullAccess policy to the user
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name terraform-en-1 --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess

# Create access keys for the user and save them in accessKeys.csv
aws iam create-access-key --user-name terraform-en-1 > accessKeys.csv

# Prepare AWS environment using provided scripts
cd mission1_en/mission1/en
chmod +x *.sh
# Set AWS credentials
./aws_set_credentials.sh accessKeys.csv
# Set GCP project ID
gcloud config set project <project_id>
# Enable necessary GCP APIs
gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com
```

**Mission 2: Building Applications on AWS and GCP**

**2.1 AWS Setup**

```bash
# Create a programmatic user with AmazonS3FullAccess permissions
aws iam create-user --user-name luxxy-covid-testing-system-en-app1
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name luxxy-covid-testing-system-en-app1 --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess

# Create access keys for the user and save them in luxxy-covid-testing-system-en-app1.csv
aws iam create-access-key --user-name luxxy-covid-testing-system-en-app1 > luxxy-covid-testing-system-en-app1.csv
```

**2.2 GCP Setup**

```bash
# Create a new user 'app' on Cloud SQL MySQL database
gcloud sql users create app --instance=<instance_name> --password=welcome123456

# Download mission2 files to Google Cloud Shell
cd ~
mkdir mission2_en
cd mission2_en
wget https://tcb-public-events.s3.amazonaws.com/icp/mission2.zip
unzip mission2.zip
# Connect to MySQL DB and create products table
mysql --host=<public_ip_cloudsql> --port=3306 -u app -p
use dbcovidtesting;
source ~/mission2_en/mission2/en/db/create_table.sql
show tables;
exit;
```

**2.3 Build Docker Image and Deploy**

```bash
# Build Docker image and push it to Google Container Registry
cd ~/mission2_en/mission2/en/app
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/<PROJECT_ID>/luxxy-covid-testing-system-app-en

# Edit Kubernetes deployment file
cd ~/mission2/en/kubernetes
# Use any text editor to edit luxxy-covid-testing-system.yaml and update the variables accordingly
# Deploy the application on GKE Cluster
kubectl apply -f luxxy-covid-testing-system.yaml
```

**Mission 3: MultiCloud Data Migration**

**3.1 GCP Database Migration**

```bash
# Download mission3 files and import the SQL dump to Cloud SQL MySQL database
cd ~
mkdir mission3_en
cd mission3_en
wget https://tcb-public-events.s3.amazonaws.com/icp/mission3.zip
unzip mission3.zip
# Connect to Cloud SQL MySQL database instance and import the dump
mysql --host=<public_ip_address> --port=3306 -u app -p
use dbcovidtesting;
source ~/mission3_en/mission3/en/db/db_dump.sql
```

**3.2 AWS PDF Files Migration**

```bash
# Download PDF files and sync them with your S3 bucket
cd mission3/en/pdf_files
aws s3 sync . s3://luxxy-covid-testing-system-pdf-en-<xxxx>

# Test the application to ensure data and files are migrated successfully
# Open the application and verify the entries under ‚ÄúView Guest Results‚Äù page
```

Following these commands and steps will help you successfully implement the Hands-on Project in the MultiCloud architecture. Remember to replace placeholders such as `<project_id>`, `<instance_name>`, and `<xxxx>` with your actual project and resource names. Happy coding! üöÄ
